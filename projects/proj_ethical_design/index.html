    class="dataset-link">Dataset</a>
  <p class="project-desc">This projects explores whether certain ethnicities have more forceful encounters
    with the police than others, as reported by the number of complaints in the dataset. This project features two
    propositions - both representing one side to the argument. Through the use of misleading visualization techniques
    such
    as filtering out certain data, skewing the x or y axis, one of the proposition will try to convince and persuade the
    viewers through unethical means. </p>
  <p class="project-desc1">Proposition 1: Graphs and trends suggest that black and hispanic complainants
    report more forceful encounters compared to other ethnicities.
  </p>
  <p>Graph One</p>
  <img src="../../images/img1-prop1.png" class="project-image">
  <p>Graph Two</p>
  <img src="../../images/img2-prop1.png" class="project-image">
  <p class="project-desc">From these two visualizations, we might get the idea that the data is trying to convey that
    certain ethnicities
    do in fact have more forceful encounters. Graph One shows that complainants of Hispanic and Black ethnicities have
    significantly higher percentage of complaints being categorized as Force. And from Graph Two we can see that the
    number
    of force complaints are substantially higher than the other ethnicities as well. Could you spot if these
    visualizations are
    indeed truthful and non-manipulative?
  </p>
  <p class="project-desc">Before we delve deeper into these graphs, we will take a look at the other side of the coin
    and analyze Proposition
    2 below.
  </p>
  <p class="project-desc1">Proposition 2: Graphs and trends suggest that there are no clear indications certain
    ethnicities report more forceful encounters in complaints.
  </p>
  <p>Graph One</p>
  <img src="../../images/img1-prop2.png" class="project-image">
  <p>Graph Two</p>
  <img src="../../images/img2-prop2.png" class="project-image">
  <p class="project-desc">From these two visualizations, we can see the tone shifted dramatically from the first
    proposition. The data now
    suggests that different ethnicity groups do not report more force complaints compared to each other.
  </p>
  <p class="project-desc">So what happened here? Let’s take a closer look at Proposition One’s Visualization first. In
    Graph 1 of Proposition
    1, we can see that the y-axis actually starts and 20% and ends at 26%. This design choice stretches the
    graph and makes it seem like certain ethnicities have significantly more percentages and is an example of a
    misleading design choice. Furthermore, for the second graph, we can see that the color of the lines for red and blue
    is very bright and eye-catching; while the colors for the other lines are fainter and in a much more muted color.
    This was done on purpose and meant to direct the viewer’s eyes onto what the graph wants to convey - which are
    those two lines. This is one of the two layered design choices included in this graph, the other being the overall
    context of the visualization. We can see that Red and Green are significantly higher than the rest - but is that
    really the case? This dataset actually contains a lot more data for these two ethnic groups compared to the others,
    so naturally their numbers will be a lot higher. This bit of context was not included as the other layer of the
    misleading visualization, which creates an image that might not be entirely truthful. </p>
  <p class="project-desc">If we look at Proposition Two, we can see that the graphs are a lot more ethically visualized.
    For example, Graph
    One from Proposition Two is the same data as Graph One from Proposition One but the y-axis is not truncated. With
    the addition of percentage labels on top, we can see that it now tells an entirely different story and displays a
    visualization that is vastly different from before. Furthermore, from Graph Two Proposition Two we can see that if
    we add context to the graphs by separating each ethnicity to be within its own self-contained visualization that
    their percentage increase is all roughly equal. </p>
  <p class="project-desc">From this project, we can see that data visualization can be manipulated in a lot of ways,
    sometimes even
    misleadingly. But where do we draw the line between unethical and untruthful designs? We think that ethical analysis
    and visualization should have truth and transparency as the number one priority. We think persuasion and deception
    mostly comes from hiding and altering a part of the visualization in a dishonest way. To be ethical is to show the
    data and its visualization for what it is, and let the viewers decide for themselves whether the proposition or the
    message of the visualization is something they align with. Forcing an idea through manipulation onto the viewers
    should be considered unethical. </p>
  <p class="project-desc">Lastly, We think boundaries are really important in determining if a visualization is
    ethically designed. The
    bounds that we define and draw to distinguish between persuasive choices vs. misleading ones is the intention of the
    visualization. We think visualizations should be set up in a way where the intention is to persuade and not to
    manipulate. The viewers should have the chance to make the decision themselves looking at the graphs, and not have a
    certain viewpoint forcefully presented to them through distorted design choices. These can include scaling the an
    axis misleadingly, filtering out data with no transparency, and misleading graph design that can inflate or deflate
    certain data points.</p>
